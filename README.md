# Advent Of Code
My solutions for some days of [Advent Of Code 2017](https://adventofcode.com/2017), [2018](https://adventofcode.com/2018), [2019](https://adventofcode.com/2019), [2020](https://adventofcode.com/2020), [2021](https://adventofcode.com/2021)  and [2022](https://adventofcode.com/2022) in various languages (more or less ordered by LOC: Rust, Clojure, Kotlin, Julia, Scala, PureScript, Elixir, Haskell, Go, Bash, F#, Python, PowerShell, Prolog, Zig, R)

Be warned that not all solutions are complete or correct. I use AoC to experiment with different languages, many of which I haven't tried at all before, so many solutions are likely not ideomatic. Also, I usually only do about 15-50% of the days, so no year is completely solved.
